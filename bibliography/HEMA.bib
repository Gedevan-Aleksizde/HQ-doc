On the pages of these books we find images of swords very different from those usually wielded by a medieval knight. Were these strange weapons intended as prototypes for specialty fighting swords, or merely as conceptual curiosities envisioned by the maestros who made their living teaching the art of defense to duelists, knights, and princes of the late Middle Ages?}

This book seeks to present these teachings in a new light, with an original English translation that is easier to read and understand than existing offerings. In this way, it will hopefully reveal this important text to a wider audience. Included are color scans, a revised transcription by Dierk Hagedorn, introductory material and an English translation by Michael Chidester, and a few notes along the way"--},

Forgeng's translation of Joachim Meyer's The Art of Sword Combat the author was alerted to an earlier recension of the work which was discovered in Lund University Library in Sweden. The manuscript, produced in Strassburg around 1568, is illustrated with thirty watercolor images and seven ink diagrams. The text covers combat with the long sword (hand-and-a-half sword), dusack (a one-handed practice weapon comparable to a saber), and rapier. The manuscript's theoretical discussion of guards is one of the most critical passages to understanding this key feature of the historical practice, not just in relation to Meyer but in relation to the medieval combat systems in general. The manuscript offers an extensive repertoire of training drills for both the dusack and the rapier, a feature largely lacking in treatises of the period as a whole but critical to modern reconstructions of the practice. The translation also includes a biography of Meyer, much of which has only recently come to light, as well as technical terminology, and other essential information for understanding and contextualizing the work.--Provided by Amazon.com},

Source material is admittedly thin, yet it is specific enough to allow us to correct many of these misconceptions and outright errors.The article initially summarises the current state of knowledge on the war horse of the period, by reference to the archaeological record. It then reviews the cavalry's battlefield tactics, derives the skill level required to execute the manoeuvres described in the sources, and analyses where and how this training could have been provided.The information gleaned provides an insight into the skills and expertise neces-sary to achieve the requisite sophisticated level of horsemanship. We shall argue that these imply a considerable investment in organisational infrastructure, per-sonnel and institutional memory, which has so far not received much academic attention, and has wider implications for our view of the era.},

And how did the simulations deal with the elements of quantity, quality, timing, and information?The analysis shows that our ancestors' perception of the reality of fighting chan-ged over time, as their interpretations of reality for the world at large changed. Considerable intellectual effort and ingenuity were invested into attempts to understand reality and formulate corresponding realistic simulations, making these ludic artefacts reflective, sometimes iconic for, and occasionally ahead of their historical-cultural context. Seemingly irrational phenomena, such as the persistence of lethal duelling, had perfectly pragmatic elements.},

  abstract = {Completed in 1482, Johannes Leck{\"u}chner's 'Art of Combat with the "Langes Messer" (Messerfechtkunst)' is among the most important documents on the combat arts of the Middle Ages. The Messer was a single-edged, one-handed utility sword peculiar to central Europe, but Leck{\"u}chner's techniques apply to cut-and-thrust swords in general. Not only is this treatise the single most substantial work on the use of one-handed swords to survive from this period, but it is the most detailed explanation of the two-handed sword techniques of the German "Liechtenauer" school dating back to the 1300s. Leck{\"u}chner's lavish manuscript consists of over four hundred illustrations with explanatory text, in which the author, a parish priest, rings the changes on bladework, deceits, and grappling, with techniques ranging from life-or-death escapes from an armed assailant to slapstick moves designed to please the crowd in public fencing matches. This translation, complete with all illustrations from the manuscript, makes the treatise accessible for the first time since the author's untimely death less than a year after its completion left his major work to be lost for generations.0An extensive introduction, notes, and glossary analyze and contextualize the work and clarify its technical content. Jeffrey L. Forgeng is curator of Arms and Armor and Medieval Art at the Worcester Art Museum, and teaches as Adjunct Professor of History at Worcester Polytechnic Institute},

The saber was the guarantee of, not only his golden freedoms, but also of his personal honor. These weapons, of various shapes and sizes, but often noted for their fearsome curves, were integral to the Polish culture, and yet little is known of their techniques when it came to their use in defense of honor and person. Using Polish documents, art, anecdotes, archeology as well as connected sources from Italy and Germany, Richard Marsden, with a team of researchers from North America and Europe, as re-created a vision of the use of the Polish saber."--Page 4 of cover.},

  abstract = {In the late XIX c., when most Western European armies in the discussion about cut and thrust strikes finally gave priority to a thrust, Russian Imperial Army adopted Eastern weapon -- shashka, with Caucasian and Asian origins. Despite its late adoption and not Russian origins, shashka quickly became a national weapon. It transformed a lot under the influence of Western European saber. It dislodged all other long-bladed weapons in Russian army and even in the national memory so that nowadays average Russian calls all curved blades ``shashka''. This weapon became a symbol of Russian Cossacks and all late Russian cavalry, almost the last long-bladed weapon used at war. This article is aimed to study techniques of fencing on shashkas of Russian Cossacks and soldiers in XIX -- XX c., well-preserved in fencing and cutting manuals, as well asarmy statutes of this period. The author makes an attempt to verify the popular idea that shashka was not used for fencing at all, that it was designed only for cutting and smashing, without any parades, thrusts, feints, tactics. At the beginning of the article a weaponological review of shashka is done. Its distinctive features, origins, types, characteristics are considered.},

The weapon underwent technological examinations by J. Piaskowski, who said that the sword was an example of Late Medieval mass manufacture of cheap and low quality weaponry with the use of cast refined iron. This assumption was maintained in later scholarship. As doubts concerning the authenticity of the sword were raised by visual examination, it was decided to repeat technological examinations. It was found out that the metal in the blade was in fact cast. However, qualitative EDS analysis of slag inclusions demonstrated a very high presence of S and Mn, which testifies to the fact that the metal in the blade was obtained with the use of one of late 19th or early 20th c. steelmaking processes (the Bessemer or Martin process). Based on this and on some external features of the sword (traces of lathe processing, punched typescript letters on the tang), it was assumed beyond doubt that the sword was a pre-1945 replica},
